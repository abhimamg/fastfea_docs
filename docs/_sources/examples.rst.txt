Examples
=====================
In this section you will see different configurations of yml file that can be used by the user. Copy the the suitable section and save it as ``input.yml`` file.


..  literalinclude:: scripts/single_case.yml
		:language: yaml
		:linenos:
		:caption: Input File

You can add cases by repeating information under the CASES keyword. Here you want to extract field outputs for two steps.

..  literalinclude:: scripts/mult_case.yml
		:language: yaml
		:linenos:
		:caption: Multiple Cases
		:emphasize-lines: 5,8,14,17

If you notice, a few information has been included twice in both the cases. A cleaner way to write the same file would be:

..  literalinclude:: scripts/mult_case_clean.yml
		:language: yaml
		:linenos:
		:caption: Multiple Cases (Cleaner Way)

Extracting multiple set types

..  literalinclude:: scripts/elem_node.yml
		:language: yaml
		:linenos:
		:caption: Element and Nodal Outputs
