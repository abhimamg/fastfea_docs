Getting Started
=====================


Install Python interpreter
---------------------------
If you have used Fastpipe installed on your system then Python 3.9 should already be installed. To check what python version is installed on your system, type the following command in command prompt. 

.. code-block:: shell
   
   py -3 --version


.. note::
  FastFEA is compatible with Python version 3.9 and above.

If you do not have python 3.9.0 installed on your system then please install from the software centre.

Installing FastFEA Package
---------------------------

Create a Virtual Environment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To create a virtual environment in which to install FastFEA, run the following, where fastfea is the name of the virtual environment being created:


.. code-block:: bash
   
   python -m venv %userprofile%\.virtualenvs\fastfea

Activate the Virtual Environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To activate the new environment, run:


.. code-block:: bash
   
   %userprofile%\.virtualenvs\fastfea\Scripts\activate

Update pip Package Manager
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
It is good practice to update the pip package manager to ensure you have the latest version:

.. code-block:: bat
   
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Install FastFEA
+++++++++++++++++++

Please download the ``.whl`` file from the teams page. Once downloaded, please follow the following commands to install fastfea.

.. code-block:: bat

    python -m pip install <whl-file>

Once installed, please run the following command to obtain the ``fastpipe.pth`` file.

.. code-block:: bat

    fastfea --show path

Move the ``fastfea.pth`` file to the abaqus installation of python so that abaqus can find the fastfea package. The python installation for Abaqus is generally found in the following folder:

``C:\SIMULIA\EstProducts\2020\win_b64\tools\SMApy\python2.7\Lib\site-packages``
